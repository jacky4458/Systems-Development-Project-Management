# Systems-Development-Project-Management

The	 assignment	 is	 a	3,000-word	 report	 that	 discusses project management lessons	learned from	
analysing	and	discussing a project or	case	study of AIB (Allied Irish Banks). 

In this project, I focused on conducting a depth analysis regarding "The Digital Transformation of AIB." It was quite challenging for me to collect and comprehend the data, but I managed to do so through perseverance and with assistance from online resources. This project outlined optimal management practices, agile methodology, and stakeholder management.
